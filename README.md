### 🏡 USA Real Estate Data Analysis & Visualization

This project focuses on cleaning, exploring, and visualizing a large USA Real Estate dataset (2.2M+ rows) using Python (Pandas) and Power BI.
The goal was to extract insights about housing prices, property sizes, and market distribution while learning how to handle big datasets efficiently.

📊 Project Workflow: 

- Data Cleaning (Python)
- Removed duplicates, missing & inconsistent values
- Fixed data types (dates, zip codes, prices)
- Handled extreme outliers (e.g., houses with 400+ bedrooms 😅)
- Final dataset reduced from 2.2M → 1.07M rows (clean & reliable)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Checked min/max ranges of key fields (price, house size, lot size, beds, baths)
- Handled missing categorical values (e.g., city, street, brokered_by)
- Generated summary statistics
- Visualization (Power BI)

Built interactive dashboards with:

- 📍 Maps (property distribution across the US)
- 📈 Price distribution (binned histogram & column charts)
- 🛏️ Bedrooms & bathrooms vs. price trends
- 🏠 House size analysis
- 🔎 Slicers for state, city, and property type
